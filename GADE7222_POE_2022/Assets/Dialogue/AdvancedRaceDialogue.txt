[NAME=Racer]So this is the big leagues...

[NAME=Manager]Yep, now you need to keep your eyes peeled instead of daydreaming the whole time.

[NAME=Racer]What's that supposed to mean?

[NAME=Manager]It means that you need to remember that this is the Advanced Race and won't be as easy as the others.

This will be similar to the Beginner Race but now the opponets are better and the race track has short-cuts you need to look out for.

[NAME=Racer]You take this too seriously, this will be a breeze!
